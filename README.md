# termbank

Terminal-based knowledge bank CLI powered by Claude AI and Obsidian vault integration.

Build and search your personal knowledge base directly from the terminal — terms, notes, and visual analyses, all stored as Markdown in your Obsidian vault and synced to GitHub.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (CLI must be available as `claude` in PATH)
- Git (for sync)
- An Obsidian vault directory (plain folder with Markdown files is fine)

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g termbank
```

## Setup

```bash
# Point termbank at your Obsidian vault
termbank config set vault /path/to/your/vault

# Enable git sync (optional)
termbank config set git.enabled true
termbank config set git.branch main
```

## Commands

### `add` — Add a term

```bash
termbank add "idempotency"
termbank add                        # interactive prompt
termbank add "CAP theorem" @paper.pdf
```

Claude generates a structured term definition with explanation, examples, related terms, and common mistakes. The term is saved as a Markdown file in `terms/` and bidirectionally linked to related terms already in your vault.

Before saving, termbank checks for similar terms already in your vault (by overlapping words) and prompts for confirmation if any are found — helping avoid near-duplicate entries.

Options:
- `-f, --force` — overwrite if term already exists (skips similarity check)

---

### `note` — Create a note

```bash
termbank note "System design interview prep"
termbank note                       # interactive prompt
termbank note "API design" @spec.md
```

Creates a free-form note in `notes/` with vault context and auto-linking.

Options:
- `-f, --force` — overwrite if note already exists

---

### `visual` — Analyze an image or diagram

```bash
termbank visual @architecture.png
termbank visual                     # interactive image picker
```

Sends an image to Claude for analysis and saves the result as a term or note in `visuals/`. Useful for whiteboard photos, architecture diagrams, or any visual reference material.

Options:
- `--type <term|note>` — document type to create
- `--title <title>` — set title explicitly
- `-f, --force` — overwrite existing

---

### `list` — List vault contents

```bash
termbank list
termbank list --type note
termbank list --tag distributed-systems
termbank list --category pattern
termbank list --confidence mastered
```

Displays a formatted table of your vault contents. Confidence levels are color-coded (learning → familiar → mastered).

---

### `search` — Search vault

```bash
termbank search "cache"
termbank search "event" --type note
```

Regex-powered search across all vault content — frontmatter fields and body text. Shows matched field and a snippet.

---

### `relate` — Link two terms

```bash
termbank relate "caching" "memoization"
```

Creates bidirectional `[[wiki-links]]` between two existing terms.

---

### `confidence` — Update mastery level

```bash
termbank confidence "idempotency" mastered
```

Valid levels: `learning` · `familiar` · `mastered`

---

### `update` — Re-enrich a term with Claude

```bash
termbank update "idempotency"
```

Sends the existing term back to Claude for enrichment. Preserves created timestamp and confidence level.

---

### `sync` — Sync vault to GitHub

```bash
termbank sync
termbank sync --pull-only
```

Commits all vault changes (terms, notes, visuals, and Obsidian metadata) and pushes to the configured remote branch. Uses `--pull-only` to fetch without pushing.

---

### `config` — Manage configuration

```bash
termbank config show
termbank config get vault
termbank config set language en
termbank config set git.autoSync true
```

## MCP Server — Claude Code Integration

termbank ships a built-in MCP server (`termbank-mcp`) that exposes your vault as tools inside a Claude Code session. This lets you save terms and notes, or query your vault, without leaving the conversation.

### Setup

Add the following to your Claude Code settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "termbank": {
      "command": "termbank-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

> If installed locally (not globally), use the full path instead:
> `"command": "node", "args": ["/path/to/termbank/dist/mcp/server.js"]`

### Available tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `termbank_add_term` | Save a term with optional summary, category, tags, explanation, examples, and related terms |
| `termbank_add_note` | Save a note with content, key points, and related terms |
| `termbank_search` | Search across both terms and notes by keyword |
| `termbank_list` | List all terms and notes in the vault |
| `termbank_get_term` | Read the full content of a term by name |
| `termbank_get_note` | Read the full content of a note by its id (filename without `.md`) |

### Example workflow

**Session A** — document an integration you just built:
> "Bu Flavor entegrasyonunu termbank'a not olarak kaydet"

Claude calls `termbank_add_note` → saved to `notes/Flavor Entegrasyonu.md`

**Session B** — apply that knowledge to a new project:
> "Termbank'taki Flavor entegrasyonu notunu oku ve bu projeye uygula"

Claude calls `termbank_search("flavor")` → finds the note with its id → calls `termbank_get_note` → reads and applies the content.

The MCP server reads your existing `~/.termbank.json` config, so vault path and all settings carry over automatically.
